  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Signing into websites is more difficult than it should be. The user agent is
  in a unique position to improve the experience in a number of ways, and most
  modern user agents have recognized this by providing some measure of
  credential management natively in the browser. Users can save usernames and
  passwords for websites, and those <a>credentials</a> are autofilled into
  sign-in forms with varying degrees of success.

  The <code><a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a></code> attribute offers a
  declarative mechanism by which websites can work with user agents to improve
  the latter's ability to detect and fill sign-in forms by marking specific
  fields as "username" or "password", and user agents implement a wide variety
  of detection heuristics to work with websites which haven't taken the time to
  provide this detail in markup.

  While this combination of heuristic and declarative detection works relatively
  well, the status quo leaves some large gaps where detection is problematic.
  Sites with uncommon sign-in mechanisms (submitting credentials via
  {{XMLHttpRequest}} [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]], for instance) are difficult to reliably
  detect, as is the increasingly common case in which users wish to authenticate
  themselves using a <a>federated identity provider</a>. Allowing websites to
  more directly interact with the user agent's credential manager would allow
  the credential manager to be more accurate on the one hand, and to assist
  users with federated sign-in on the other.

  These use cases are explored in more detail in [[#use-cases]] and in
  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/usecases/credentialmanagement/">
  Credential Management: Use Cases and Requirements</a>; this specification
  attempts to address many of the requirements that document outlines by
  defining a Credential Manager API which a website can use to request
  <a>credentials</a> for a user, and to ask the user agent to persist
  credentials when a user signs in successfully.

  Note: The API defined here is intentionally small and simple: it does not
  intend to provide authentication in and of itself, but is limited to providing
  an interface to the existing credential managers implemented by existing user
  agents. That functionality is valuable <em>right now</em>, without significant
  effort on the part of either vendors or authors. There's certainly quite a bit
  more which could be done, of course. See [[#future-work]] for some thoughts
  we've punted for now, but which could be explored in future iterations of this
  API.

  <section>
    <h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

    Modern user agents generally offer users the capability to save passwords
    when signing into a website, and likewise offer the capability to fill those
    passwords into sign-in forms fully- or semi-automatically when users return
    to a website. From the perspective of a website, this behavior is completely
    invisible: the website doesn't know that passwords have been stored, and it
    isn't notified that passwords have been filled. This is both good and bad.
    On the one hand, a user agent's password manager works regardless of whether
    or not a site cooperates, which is excellent for users. On the other, the
    password managers' behaviors are a fragile and proprietary hodgepodge of
    heuristics meant to detect and fill sign-in forms, password change forms,
    etc.

    A few problems with the status quo stand out as being particularly
    problematic:

    <ul>
      <li>
        User agents have an incredibly difficult time helping users with
        federated identity providers. While detecting a username/password
        form submission is fairly straightforward, detecting sign-in via a
        third-party is quite difficult to reliably do well. It would be nice
        if a website could help the user agent understand the intent behind the
        redirects associated with a typical federated sign-in action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Likewise, user agents struggle to detect more esoteric sign-in
        mechanisms than simple username/password forms. Authors increasingly
        asynchronously sign users in via {{XMLHttpRequest}} or similar
        mechanisms in order to improve the experience and take more control over
        the presentation. This is good for users, but tough for user agents to
        integrate into their password managers. It would be nice if a website
        could help the user agent make sense of the sign-in mechanism they
        choose to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, changing passwords is less well-supported than it could be if
        the website explicitly informed the user agent that credentials had
        changed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="introduction-examples">Examples</h3>

    <h4 id="examples-password-signin">Password-based Sign-in</h4>

    A website that supports only username/password pairs can request
    credentials, and use them in existing sign-in forms:

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
        navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()" for="CredentialsContainer">get</a>({ "<a for="CredentialRequestOptions" dict-member>password</a>": true }).then(
            function(credential) {
              if (!credential) {
                // The user either doesn't have credentials for this site, or
                // refused to share them. Insert some code here to show a basic
                // login form (or, ideally, do nothing, since this API should
                // really be progressive enhancement on top of an existing form).
                return;
              }
              if (credential.type == "<a const>password</a>") {
                fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" })
                  .then(function (response) {
                    // Notify the user that signin succeeded! Do amazing, signed-in things!
                  });
              } else {
                // See <a href="#examples-federated-signin">the Federated Sign-in example</a>
              }
            });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-federated-signin">Federated Sign-in</h4>

    A website that supports <a>federated identity providers</a> as well as
    passwords can request credentials, and use them to kick off the sign-in flow
    for the user's chosen provider:

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
        navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()" for="CredentialsContainer">get</a>({
          "<a for="CredentialRequestOptions" dict-member>password</a>": true,
          "<a dict-member>federated</a>": {
            "<a idl>providers</a>": [ "https://www.facebook.com", "https://accounts.google.com" ]
          }
        }).then(
            function(credential) {
              if (!credential)
                return;

              if (credential.type == "<a const>federated</a>") {
                switch (credential.<a idl for="FederatedCredential">provider</a>) {
                case "https://www.facebook.com/":
                  // Use Facebook's SDK, a la
                  // <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/#logindialog">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/#logindialog</a>
                  FB.login(function (response) {
                    if (response.status === "authorized") {
                      // Can now use FB.api() calls
                    } else {
                      // Explain to the user that we would really like them to
                      // click "Log me in".
                    }
                  });
                  break;

                case "https://accounts.google.com/":
                  // Ditto
                  break;

                // ...
                }
              } else {
                fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" })
                  .then(function (response) { ... })
                  .catch(function (response) { ... });
              }
            });
      </pre>

      Note: This API does not go out to the identity provider to grab a token,
      or authenticate the user in any way. It provides a hint to the website as
      to which identity provider the user prefers to use, and little more. See
      [[#future-work]] for directions future versions of this API could take.
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-post-signin">Post-sign-in Confirmation</h4>

    To ensure that credentials are persisted correctly, it may be useful for a
    website to tell the credential manager that sign-in succeeded.

    <div class="example">
      If a user is signed in by calling {{fetch()}} on a {{PasswordCredential}}
      object, submitting that data to a sign-in endpoint, then we can check the
      response to determine whether the user was signed in successfully, and
      notify the user agent accordingly. Given a sign-in form like the following:

      <pre>
        &lt;form action="https://example.com/login" method="POST" id="theForm"&gt;
          &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
          &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>username</a>"&gt;
          &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
          &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>current-password</a>"&gt;
          &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>

      Then the developer can handle the form submission with something like the
      following handler:

      <pre>
        document.querySelector('#theForm').addEventListener("submit", e =&gt; {
            if (<a attribute lt="credentials">navigator.credentials</a>) {
              e.preventDefault();

              // Construct a new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> from the <a idl>HTMLFormElement</a>
              // that fired the "submit" event: this will suck up the values of the fields
              // labeled with "username" and "current-password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>
              // attributes:
              var c = new <a idl lt="PasswordCredential(form)">PasswordCredential</a>(e.target);

              // Fetch the form's action URL, passing that new credential object in
              // as the fetch's credentials. If the response indicates success, ask
              // the user agent to ask the user to store the credential for future use:
              var init = { method: "POST", credentials: c };
              fetch(e.target.action, init).then(r =&gt; {
                if (/* |r| is a "successful" <a idl>Response</a> */)
                  <a idl lt="store()">navigator.credentials.store</a>(c);
              });
            }
        });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      If we're using a <a>federated identity provider</a>:

      <pre>
        if (<a attribute lt="credentials">navigator.credentials</a>) {
          navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="store()">store</a>(
            new <a idl>FederatedCredential</a>({
              "<a idl for="CredentialData">id</a>": "username",
              "<a idl for="FederatedCredentialData">provider</a>": "https://federation.com"
            })
          );
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-change-password">Change Password</h4>

    This same storage mechanism can be reused for "password change" with no
    modifications: if the user changes her credentials, the website can notify
    the user agent that she's successfully signed in with new credentials. The
    user agent can then update the credentials it stores:

    <div class="example">
      MegaCorp Inc. allows users to change their passwords by POSTing data to
      a backend server asynchronously. After doing so successfully, they can
      update the user's credentials by calling {{CredentialsContainer/store()}}
      with the new information.

      Given a password change form like the following:

      <pre>
        &lt;form action="https://example.com/changePassword" method="POST" id="theForm"&gt;
          &lt;input type="hidden" name="username" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>username</a>" value="user"&gt;
          &lt;label for="password"&gt;New Password&lt;/label&gt;
          &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>new-password</a>"&gt;
          &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>

      The developer can handle the form submission with something like the following:

      <pre>
        document.querySelector('#theForm').addEventListener("submit", e =&gt; {
          if (<a attribute lt="credentials">navigator.credentials</a>) {
            e.preventDefault();

            // Construct a new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> from the <a idl>HTMLFormElement</a>
            // that fired the "submit" event: this will suck up the values of the fields
            // labeled with "username" and "new-password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>
            // attributes:
            var c = new <a idl lt="PasswordCredential(form)">PasswordCredential</a>(e.target);

            // Fetch the form's action URL, passing that new credential object in

            fetch(e.target.action, init).then(r =&gt; {
              if (/* |r| is a "successful" <a idl>Response</a> */)
                <a idl lt="store()">navigator.credentials.store</a>(c);
            });
          }
        });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-legacy">Layering on top of a legacy system</h4>

    The API is designed in such a way as to cleanly sit on top of an existing
    password-based sign-in system's backend. For instance, the username and
    password parameters can be renamed by adjusting the {{PasswordCredential}}'s
    {{PasswordCredential/idName}} and {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}}
    attributes, and additional data can be added to a request by setting the
    {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute.

    <div class="example">
      MegaCorp Inc. has an existing sign-in system that expects the username
      to be submitted as a parameter named "`u`" and a the password as a
      parameter named "`p`". The following code accomplishes this:

      <pre>
        // Given a <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> |credential|:
        credential.idName = "u";
        credential.passwordName = "p";
        fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Further, MegaCorp Inc. protects itself against attack by appending a CSRF
      token to the request. The following code accomplishes this:

      <pre>
        // Given a <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> |credential|:
        credential.<a idl>additionalData</a> = new FormData();
        credential.<a idl>additionalData</a>.append("csrf", "[random token value goes here]");
        
        fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      MegaCorp Inc.'s backend servers cannot accept POST requests submitted as
      `multipart/form-data`. They need to submit the credential information as
      `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead. They can accomplish this by
      setting the {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute to a
      {{URLSearchParams}} object (which serializes as a urlencoded submission):

      <pre>
        // Given a <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> |credential|:
        credential.<a idl>additionalData</a> = new URLSearchParams();
        
        // Note that MegaCorp Inc. doesn't need to append any data to the
        // object. Setting `additionalData` to an empty `URLSearchParams` object
        // is enough to change the content type of the submission.
        
        fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <dd>
      Broadly speaking, <strong>credential</strong> is an assertion about an
      entity which enables a trust decision. This specification defines two
      specific types of credentials which are useful for authentication:
      "password" credentials, which consist of a username/password
      pair, and "federated" credentials, which point out to a <a>federated
      identity provider</a> which is trusted to correctly assert a user's
      authentication.

      Note: These two types are, of course, not exhaustive. Future versions of
      this and other documents will likely define other types of credentials.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <dfn export>Credential Store</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <strong>credential store</strong> is an opaque storage mechanism which
      offers a user agent the ability to:
     
      1. Store, retrieve, and modify {{Credential}} objects.
      2. To mark an <a>origin</a> with a <dfn>requires user mediation</dfn> flag.
      3. To associate an <a>origin</a> with a <dfn>protocol set</dfn>.
      
      The implementation is vendor-specific, and the interface provided is not
      exposed to the web.

      Note: The types of credentials defined in this document are stored locally
      in a user agent's credential store, but future versions of this and other
      documents will likely define credential types which are external to the
      user agent.

      <dfn export local-lt="IDP|identity provider">
        Federated Identity Provider
      </dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <strong>federated identity provider</strong> is an entity which a
      website trusts to correctly authenticate a user, and which provides an
      API for that purpose. <a href="http://openid.net/developers/specs/">OpenID
      Connect</a> is an example of such a framework, used by a number of
      providers.

  <h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2>

  <h3 id="interfaces-credential-types">Credential Types</h3>

  This document defines a generic and extensible {{Credential}} interface from
  which all <a>credentials</a> will inherit, and a slightly less generic
  {{SiteBoundCredential}}, which defines the specific attributes shared
  by any <a>Credential</a> persisted in user agent's <a>credential store</a>.

  {{PasswordCredential}} and {{FederatedCredential}} both inherit from
  {{SiteBoundCredential}}, and, as you might expect, are the concrete types
  mapped to <a>password credentials</a> and <a>federated credentials</a>,
  respectively.

  <h4 id="interfaces-credential-types-credential"><code>Credential</code></h4>
  <pre class="idl">
    dictionary CredentialData {
      required USVString id;
    };

    interface Credential {
      readonly attribute USVString id;
      readonly attribute DOMString type;
    };
    Credential implements Transferable;
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="Credential">
    <dt><dfn attribute>id</dfn></dt>

      The credential's identifier. This might be a GUID, username, or email
      address, for instance.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn attribute>type</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The credential's type. This attribute's getter returns the value of the
      credential's {{[[type]]}} slot.

      Note: The {{[[type]]}} slot's value will be the same for all
      credentials implementing a particular interface. Currently,
      {{PasswordCredential}} objects have a {{[[type]]}} of
      <code>password</code>, and {{FederatedCredential}} objects have a
      {{[[type]]}} of <code>federated</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn attribute>\[[type]]</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      All {{Credential}} objects have an internal slot named
      {{[[type]]}}, which unsurprisingly contains a string representing
      the type of the credential. This property is exposed to the web via the
      {{Credential/type}} attribute.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  {{Credential}} objects implement {{Transferable}}, and MUST support the
  the <a>structured clone</a> algorithm. Unless otherwise specified, the cloning
  mechanism for all objects which implement {{Credential}} is defined in
  [[#clone-credential]].

  <pre class="idl">
    dictionary SiteBoundCredentialData : CredentialData {
      USVString name;
      USVString iconURL;

      readonly attribute USVString iconURL;

    <code>SiteBoundCredential</code>
  </h4>

  <dl dfn-for="SiteBoundCredential">
    <dt><dfn attribute>name</dfn></dt>

      A name associated with the credential, intended as a human-understandable
      public name.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn attribute>iconURL</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A URL pointing to an image for the credential. This URL MUST be an
      <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated URL</a>.

      ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#247): Anne suggests that this might be better modeled
      as an <code>ImageBitmap</code> or <code>blob:</code>. We also need to
      figure out responsiveness. Perhaps [[MANIFEST]]'s format?
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn attribute>\[[origin]]</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      All {{SiteBoundCredential}} objects have an internal slot named
      {{[[origin]]}}, which stores the <a>origin</a> to which the credential is
      bound. This property is not directly exposed to the web.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  All {{SiteBoundCredential}} objects MUST define an <dfn>options matching
  algorithm</dfn> which returns <dfn><code>Match</code></dfn> if the object

    `PasswordCredential(HTMLFormElement form)` Constructor
  </h5>

  The <dfn constructor for="PasswordCredential">`PasswordCredential(form)`</dfn>
  constructor, when invoked with an {{HTMLFormElement}} (|form|), must run these
  steps.
  
  Note: [[#examples-post-signin]] and [[#examples-change-password]] provide 
  examples of the intended usage.

  1.  Let |data| be a new {{PasswordCredentialData}} dictionary.

  2.  Let |formData| be the result of executing the {{FormData}} constructor
      on |form|.

  3.  Let |elements| be a list of all the <a>submittable elements</a> whose
      <a>form owner</a> is |form|, in <a>tree order</a>.

  4.  Let |idName| and |passwordName| be empty strings.

  5.  For each |field| in |elements|, run the following steps:

      1.  If |field| does not have an <{input/autocomplete}> attribute, then
          skip to the next |field|.

      2.  Let |name| be the value of |field|'s <{input/name}> attribute.

      3.  If |formData|'s {{FormData/has()}} method returns `false` when executed
          on |name|, then skip to the next |field|.

      4.  If |field|'s <{input/autocomplete}> attribute's value contains one or
          more <a>autofill detail tokens</a> (|tokens|), then:
          
          1.  For each |token| in |tokens|:
          
              1.  If |token| is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one
                  of the following strings, run the associated steps:

                  :   "<a attr-value>`current-password`</a>"
                  :   "<a attr-value>`new-password`</a>"

                      on |name|, and |idName| to |name|.

  6.  Let |c| be the result of executing the {{PasswordCredential(data)}}
      constructor on |data|. Rethrow any exception generated.

  7.  Set |c|'s {{PasswordCredential/idName}} attribute to |idName|.

  8.  Set |c|'s {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}} attribute to |passwordName|.

  9.  If |form|'s <a for="form">enctype</a> is "`multipart/form-data`",
      then:
     
      1.  Set |c|'s {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute
          to |formData|.

      Otherwise:

      1.  Let |params| be a new {{URLSearchParams}} object.

      2.  For each |entry| in |formData|'s <a for="FormData">entries</a>:

          1.  If |entry|'s <a for="entry">type</a> is "file", skip to the
              next |entry|.

          2.  Execute |params| {{URLSearchParams/append()}} method on
              |entry|'s <a for="entry">name</a> and <a for="entry">value</a>.

      3.  Set |c|'s {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute
          to |params|.

  10. Return |c|.

      Request a credential from the credential manager.

      The {{CredentialsContainer/get(options)/options}} argument contains an object

      <var>options</var>.

      Note: If and when we need to support returning more than a single
      credential in response to a single call, we will likely introduce a
      <code>getAll()</code> method which would return

  In order to obtain the desired {{Credential}} via
  {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}, the caller specifies a few parameters in a
  {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object.

  Note: The {{CredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary is an extension point. If and
  when new types of credentials are introduced that require options, their
  dictionary types will be added to the dictionary so they can be passed into the
  request. See [[#implementation-extension]].

  Every site should use the same identifier when referring to a specific

  shouldn't be "Facebook" and "Facebook Login" and "FB" and "FBL" and
  "Facebook.com" and so on. It should have a canonical identifier which everyone
  can make use of, as consistent identification makes it possible for user
  agents to be helpful.

  For consistency, federations passed into the APIs defined in this document
  (e.g. {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions}}'s
  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} array, or
  {{FederatedCredential}}'s {{FederatedCredential/provider}} property)
  MUST be identified by the <a>ASCII serialization</a> of the origin the
  provider uses for sign in. That is, Facebook would be represented by
  <code>https://www.facebook.com</code> and Google by
  <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>.

  The ASCII serialization of an origin does <em>not</em> include a trailing
  U+002F SOLIDUS ("<code>/</code>"), but user agents SHOULD accept them
  silently: <code>https://accounts.google.com/</code> is clearly intended to
  be the same as <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>.

<!-- Big Text: Fetch -->
<section>
  <h3 id="fetch-integration">Integration with Fetch</h3>
  
  In order to actually authenticate a user, {{PasswordCredential}} objects may
  be submitted to a server for evaluation. To prevent the risk that sensitive
  credential information will be exposed directly to a page's JavaScript (see
  [[#security-cross-origin-leakage]]), we hide the credential information in
  non-web-exposed slots on the {{PasswordCredential}} object, and extract them
  during {{fetch()}} in ways that will remain opaque to anything other than the
  remote (same-origin) server.

  {{PasswordCredential}} objects may be bound to a {{Request}} by passing them
  into the {{Request}} constructor as the "`credentials`" member of a
  {{RequestInit}} object:
 
  <pre class="example">
    [ Given a `PasswordCredential` named 'c' ]
    var init = {
      method: "POST",
      credentials: c
    };
    var r = new Request("https://example.com/endpoint", init);
  </pre>

  Note: The credential information will be transmitted as the request's body,
  just as it would be for a form submission. This means that the "`method`"
  cannot be "`GET`".

  Until the request hits the network, the credential object will be hidden from
  JavaScript. Once the user agent determines that the {{Request}} is going to
  hit the network (that is, once Fetch hits the
  "<a>HTTP-network-or-cache fetch</a>" algorithm), the {{PasswordCredential}}
  will be serialized into a body and content type as defined in
  [[#body-extraction]], and the request will proceed out to the server-side
  authentication endpoint.

  <h4 id="monkey-patching">Monkey Patches to Fetch</h4>

  To accomplish the above, Fetch could be modified in the following ways:

  1.  A <a>request</a> has an associated <dfn for="request">attached
      credential</dfn> (null, or a {{PasswordCredential}}). Unless stated
      otherwise, it is null.

  2.  A <a>request</a>'s <a for="request">credentials mode</a> gains a new
      "`password`" value, which implies the same behavior as "`include`", with
      the additional assertion that the <a>request</a> has a non-null
      <a for="request">attached credential</a> which will be serialized into
      its <a for="request">body</a> when it hits the network.
      
  3.  The {{RequestCredentials}} enum is renamed to "`RequestCredentialsMode`,
      and likewise updated with the new "`password`" value:

      <pre class="idl">
        enum RequestCredentialsMode { "omit", "same-origin", "include", "password" };
      </pre>

  4.  The {{RequestInit}} dictionary is updated to accept a
      {{PasswordCredential}} as its `credentials` member:

      <pre class="idl">
        typedef (<a>PasswordCredential</a> or RequestCredentials) CredentialInfo;

        partial dictionary RequestInit {
          CredentialInfo credentials;
        };
      </pre>

  5.  Replace step 20 of the current {{Request}} constructor with the following:

      20. If |credentials| is non-null:

          1.  If |credentials| is a {{PasswordCredential}}, then set |request|'s
              <a for="request">credentials mode</a> to "`password`", and
              |request|'s <a for="request">attached credential</a> to
              |credentials|.

              Otherwise, set |request|'s <a for="request">credentials mode</a>
              to |credentials|.

  6.  Replace step 32 of the current {{Request}} constructor with the following:

      32. If |request|'s <a for="request">method</a> is `GET` or `HEAD`, then
          throw a `TypeError` if any of the following are true:

          *   <var ignore>init</var>'s `body` member is present and non-null
          *   <var ignore>inputBody</var> is non-null
          *   |request|'s <a for="request">attached credential</a> is non-null

  7.  The <a>HTTP-network-or-cache fetch</a> algorithm is updated with the
      following step after the existing step 2:

      3.  If |httpRequest|'s <a for="request">attached credential</a> is not
          null, run these substeps:

          1.  Assert: |httpRequest|'s <a for="request">body</a> is null.

          2.  Let |body| and |type| be the result of running
              [[#body-extraction]] on |httpRequest|.

          3.  If |type| is the empty string, return a <a>network error</a>.

          4.  Let |httpRequest|'s <a for="request">body</a> be |body|,
              <var ignore>Content-Type</var> be |type|, and <a for="request">redirect
              mode</a> be "`manual`".

  ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#237): These patches are combined into an outstanding
  pull request against Fetch.

  <h4 id="body-extraction" algorithm>
    Extract a |body| and |Content-Type| for |request|'s attached credential
  </h4>

  Given a {{Request}} (|request|), this algorithm returns a {{Body}} (|body|) and
  a string (|Content-Type|):

  1.  Let |credential| be |request|'s <a>attached credential</a>.

  2.  Let |body| be a new <a for="request">body</a>, and |Content-Type| be the empty string.

  3.  If |credential| is a {{PasswordCredential}}, run these substeps.

      1.  If |request|'s <a for="request">url</a>'s scheme is not the same as
          |request|'s <a for="request">client</a>'s {{URL/origin}}'s scheme,
          or |request|'s <a for="request">url</a>'s host's <a>registerable
          domain</a> is not the same as |request|'s
          <a for="request">client</a>'s {{URL/origin}}'s host's <a>registerable
          domain</a>, then skip the remaining substeps.

      2.  Let |data| be a copy of |credential|'s
          {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute if it is not
          `undefined`, and a new {{FormData}} object otherwise.

      3.  Let |list| be an empty list.

      4.  If |data| is a {{FormData}} object, then:

          1.  Set |list| to a copy of |data|'s <a for="FormData">entries</a>.

          2.  Remove all <a>entry</a> objects from |list| whose
              <a for="entry">name</a> is either |credential|'s
              {{PasswordCredential/idName}} or |credential|'s
              {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}}.

          3.  Let |entry| be a new <a>entry</a> whose <a for="entry">name</a>
              is |credential|'s {{PasswordCredential/idName}} and whose
              <a for="entry">value</a> is |credential|'s {{Credential/id}}.

          4.  Append |entry| to |list|.

          5.  Let |entry| be a new <a>entry</a> whose <a for="entry">name</a>
              is |credential|'s {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}} and whose
              <a for="entry">value</a> is |credential|'s {{[[password]]}}.

          6.  Append |entry| to |list|.

          7.  Push the result of running the <a>`multipart/form-data` encoding
              algorithm</a>, with |list| as the form data set and with "`utf-8`" as
              the explicit character encoding, to |body|'s
              <a for="body">stream</a>.

          8.  Set |Content-Type| to `multipart/form-data;boundary=`, followed by the
              <a>`multipart/form-data` boundary string</a> generated by the
              multipart/form-data encoding algorithm.

          Otherwise |data| is a {{URLSearchParams}} object, so:

          1.  Set |list| to a copy of |data|'s
              <a for="URLSearchParams">list</a>.

          2.  Remove all name-value pairs from |list| whose name is either
              |credential|'s {{PasswordCredential/idName}} or |credential|'s
              {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}}.

          3.  Append a new name-value pair to |list| whose name is 
              |credential|'s {{PasswordCredential/idName}} and whose value is
              |credential|'s {{Credential/id}}.

          4.  Append a new name-value pair to |list| whose name is 
              |credential|'s {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}} and whose value
              is |credential|'s {{[[password]]}}.

          5.  Push the result of running the
              <a>`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` serializer</a>, with
              |list|, to |body|'s <a for="body">stream</a>.

          6.  Set |Content-Type| to
              `application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8`.

  4.  Return |body| and |Content-Type|.

  Note: Currently, we reject a call to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} if the

  type in the same request as an {{PasswordCredential}}). We may wish to define
  a more graceful fallback mechanism if/when new credential types are defined.

  <h4 id="store-credential">

  Given a {{Credential}} object (<var>credential</var>), this algorithm executes
  a type-specific storage algorithm. {{SiteBoundCredential}} objects will

  <h2 id="user-mediation">User Mediation</h2>

  Exposing credential information to the web via an API has a number of
  potential impacts on user privacy. The user agent, therefore, MUST
  involve the user in a number of cases in order to ensure that she clearly
  understands what's going on, and with whom her credentials are being shared.

  <h3 id="user-mediated-storage">Storing and Updating Credentials</h3>

  Credential information is sensitive data, and users MUST remain in control
  of that information's storage. Inadvertent credential storage could, for
  instance, unexpectedly link a user's local profile on a particular device to
  a specific online persona. To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Credential information MUST NOT be stored or updated without explicit
      user consent. For example, the user agent could display a "Save this
      password?" dialog box to the user in response to each call to
      {{store()}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      User consent MAY be requested every time a credential is stored or
      updated, <strong>or</strong> the user agent MAY request a more persistent
      grant of consent which would apply to some or all subsequent API
      operations.

      For example, a user agent may offer an option to "Always save passwords",
      or "Always save password on this site".
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents SHOULD notify users when credentials are stored. This might
      take the form of an icon in the address bar, or some similar location.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST allow users to manually remove stored credentials. This
      functionality might be implemented as a settings page, or via interaction
      with a notification as described above.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="user-mediation-requirements">Requiring User Mediation</h3>

  If a an <a>origin</a>'s <a>requires user mediation</a> flag is set to
  <code>false</code> in the user agent's <a>credential store</a>, then
  {{Credential}} objects from that origin MAY be provided to pages from that
  origin without user interaction. The user will be signed-in to that origin
  persistently, which, on the one hand, is desirable from the perspective of
  usability and convenience, but which might nevertheless surprise the user.

  If the user agent syncs the state of a {{Credential}} between devices, an
  origin could explicitly tie the devices together in a way which might surprise
  their owner.

  To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  <ol>
    <li>
      User agents MUST allow users to require user mediation for {{Credential}}
      objects. This functionality might be implemented as a global toggle that
      requires user mediation for all origins, or via more granular settings
      for specific origins (or specific credentials on specific origins).
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST NOT set an origin's <a>requires user mediation</a> slot's
      value to <code>false</code> without user consent. For example, the
      <a>credential chooser</a> described in [[#user-mediated-selection]] could
      have a checkbox which the user could toggle to mark the selected
      credential as available without mediation for the origin, or the user
      agent could have an onboarding process for its credential manager which
      asked a user for a default setting.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST notify users when credentials are provided to an
      origin. This could take the form of an icon in the address bar, or some
      similar location.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a user clears her browsing data for an origin (cookies, localStorage,
      and so on), the user agent MUST require user mediation for that origin
      by executing the algorithm defined in
      [[#require-user-mediation-for-origin]].
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="user-mediated-selection">Credential Selection</h3>

  When responding to a call to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} on an origin
  without credentials that are available without user mediation, user agents
  MUST ask the user for permission to share credential information. This SHOULD
  take the form of a <dfn local-lt="chooser">credential chooser</dfn> which
  presents the user with a list of credentials that are available for use on a
  site, allowing her to select one which should be provided to the website, or
  to reject the request entirely.

  The chooser interface SHOULD be implemented in such a way as to be
  distinguishable from UI which a website could produce. For example, the
  chooser might overlap the user agent's UI in some unspoofable way.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include an indication of the origin which is
  requesting credentials.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include all {{Credential}} objects associated
  with the origin that requested credentials.

  <em>The following image is an exceptionally non-normative mock:</em>

  <img src="./mock-chooser.png" alt="A mockup of what a chooser might look like.">

  User agents MAY internally associate information with each {{Credential}}
  object beyond the attributes specified in this document in order to enhance
  the utility of such a chooser. For example, favicons could help disambiguate
  identity providers, etc. Any additional information stored MUST not be
  exposed directly to the web.

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="security-cross-origin-leakage">Cross-origin Credential Leakage</h3>

  Credentials are sensitive information, and user agents need to exercise
  caution in determining when they can be safely shared with a website. The
  safest option is to restrict credential sharing to the exact origin on
  which they were saved. That is likely too restrictive for the web, however:
  consider sites which divide functionality into subdomains:
  <code>example.com</code> vs <code>admin.example.com</code>.

  As a compromise between annoying users, and securing their credentials, user
  agents:

  <ol>
    <li>
      MUST NOT share credentials between origins whose scheme components are
      not the same. That is: credentials saved on
      <code>https://example.com/</code> will never be available to
      <code>http://example.com/</code> via a user agent's autofill mechanism
    </li>
    <li>
      MAY use the Public Suffix List [[!PSL]] to determine the effective scope
      of a credential by comparing the <a>registerable domains</a> of the
      credential's {{[[origin]]}} with the origin in which
      {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called. That is: credentials saved on
      <code>https://admin.example.com/</code> and
      <code>https://example.com/</code> MAY be offered to users when
      {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called from
      <code>https://www.example.com/</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      MUST NOT offer credentials to an origin in response to
      {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} without user mediation if the credential's
      origin is not an exact match for the calling origin. That is,
      {{Credential}} objects for <code>https://example.com</code> would not be
      returned directly to <code>https://www.example.com</code>, but could be
      offered to the user via the chooser.
    </li>
  </ol>

  {{PasswordCredential}}s further mitigate the risk of data leakage by never
  exposing the {{[[password]]}} slot directly to a page's JavaScript, but only
  allowing its submission to a same-origin server-side endpoint via {{fetch()}}.

  Additionally, authors SHOULD mitigate the risk of leakage by setting a
  reasonable Content Security Policy [[!CSP]] which restricts the origins to
  which data can be sent. In particular, authors should ensure that the
  following directives are set, explicitly or implicitly, in
  their pages' policies:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <code><a>connect-src</a></code> further restricts the origins to which
      {{fetch()}} may submit data (which mitigates the risk of redirect-based
      attacks).
    </li>
    <li>
      <code><a>child-src</a></code> restricts the nested browsing
      contexts which may be embedded in a page, making it more difficult to
      inject a malicious {{postMessage()}} target. [[WEBMESSAGING]]
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="security-same-origin-leakage">Same-origin Leakage</h3>

  Cross-site scripting attacks could make it possible to exploit
  {{PasswordCredential}}'s integration with {{fetch()}} in order to leak
  credential information via a vulnerable same-origin endpoint. To mitigate
  this kind of risk, authors SHOULD set a reasonable Content Security Policy
  which restricts the kinds of content which can execute in their sites'
  context. [[!CSP]] Moreover, authors should ensure that both
  <code><a>script-src</a></code> and <code><a>object-src</a></code> directives
  are set in any policy they specify in order to ensure that only trusted
  script is executed on a page with access to a user's credentials.

  <h3 id="security-origin-confusion">Origin Confusion</h3>

  If framed pages have access to the APIs defined here, it might be possible
  to confuse a user into granting access to credentials for an origin other
  than the <a>top-level browsing context</a>, which is the only security origin
  which users can reasonably be expected to understand.

  Therefore, <a>Nested browsing contexts</a> and other environments like
  Workers [[WORKERS]] cannot receive or store {{Credential}} objects; the user
  agent MUST reject promises generated by calls to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}
  and {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} with a <code>SecurityError</code> when
  called from a context which is not a <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

  See the algorithms defined in [[#request-credential]] and [[#store-credential]]
  for details.

  <h3 id="security-insecure-origins">Insecure Sites</h3>

  User agents MUST NOT expose the APIs defined here to environments which are
  not <a>secure contexts</a>. User agents MAY implement autofill mechanisms
  which store user credentials and fill sign-in forms on
  non-<a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated URLs</a>, but those sites cannot
  be trusted to interact directly with the credential manager in any meaningful
  way, and those sites MUST NOT have access to credentials saved in <a>secure
  contexts</a> (as discussed in [[#security-cross-origin-leakage]].

  <h3 id="security-xss">Script Injection</h3>

  If a malicious party is able to inject script into an origin, they could
  (among many other things you wouldn't like) overwrite the behavior of
  {{store()}} to steal a user's credentials as they're written into the
  <a>credential store</a>.

  Authors SHOULD mitigate the risk of such attacks by properly escaping input
  and output, and add layers of defense in depth by setting a reasonably
  strong Content Security Policy [[CSP]] which restricts the origins from
  which script can be injected, and by using Subresource Integrity checks
  [[SRI]] to ensure that only trusted JavaScript is executed.

  <h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="privacy-timing-attacks">Timing Attacks</h3>

  If the user has no credentials for an origin, a call to
  {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} will resolve very quickly indeed. A malicious
  website could distinguish between a user with no credentials and a user with
  credentials who chooses not to share them.

  This could allow a malicious website to determine if a user has credentials
  saved for particular federated identity providers by repeatedly calling
  {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} with a single item in the
  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} array. The risk is mitigated
  by the fact that the user would, sooner or later, be prompted to provide
  credentials to the site which would certainly raise her suspicions as to its
  behavior.

  User agents SHOULD also rate-limit credential requests. It's almost certainly
  abusive for a page to request credentials more than a few times in a short
  period.

  <h3 id="privacy-signout">Signing-Out</h3>

  If a user has chosen to automatically sign-in to websites, as discussed
  in [[#user-mediation-requirements]], then the user agent will provide
  credentials to an origin whenever it asks for them. The website can instruct
  the user agent to suppress this behavior by calling {{CredentialsContainer}}'s
  {{CredentialsContainer/requireUserMediation()}} method, which will turn off
  automatic sign-in for a given origin.

  The user agent relies on the website to do the right thing; an inattentive (or
  malicious) website could simply neglect to call this method, causing the user
  agent to continue providing credentials against the user's apparent intention.

  The user MUST have some control over this behavior. As noted in
  [[#user-mediation-requirements]], clearing cookies for an origin will also
  reset that origin's <a>requires user mediation</a> flag in the <a>credential
  store</a> to `true`. Additionally, we recommend that the user agent provide
  some UI affordance for disabling automatic sign-in for a particular origin.
  This could be tied to the notification that credentials have been provided to
  an origin, for example.

  <h3 id="privacy-chooser-leakage">Chooser Leakage</h3>

  If a user agent displays images supplied by a website or federation (for
  example, if a {{Credential}}'s {{SiteBoundCredential/iconURL}} is displayed),
  requests for these images MUST NOT be directly tied to instantiating the
  chooser in order to avoid leaking chooser usage. One option would be to fetch
  the images in the background when saving or updating a {{Credential}}, and to
  cache them for the lifetime of the {{Credential}}.

  These images MUST be fetched with the <code>credentials</code> mode set to
  "<code>omit</code>", the <code>skip-service-worker flag</code> set, the
  <code>client</code> set to <code>null</code>, the <code>initiator</code> set
  to the empty string, and the <code>destination</code> set to
  <code>subresource</code>.

  Moreover, if the user agent allows the user to change either the name or icon
  associated with the credential, the alterations to the data SHOULD NOT be
  exposed to the website (consider a user who names two credentials for an
  origin "My fake account" and "My real account", for instance).

  <h3 id="locally-stored-data">Locally Stored Data</h3>

  This API offers an <a>origin</a> the ability to store data persistently along
  with a user's profile. Since most user agents treat credential data
  differently than "browsing data" (cookies, etc.) this might have the side
  effect of surprising a user who might believe that all traces of an origin
  have been wiped out when they clear their cookies.

  User agents SHOULD provide UI that makes it clear to a user that credential
  data is stored for an origin, and SHOULD make it easy for users to remove
  such data when they're no longer interested in keeping it around.

  Moreover, the <a>credential store</a>'s association between <a>origins</a>
  and <a>protocol sets</a> SHOULD be cleared along with "browsing data" if
  no {{Credential}} has been stored for the origin.

  <h3 id="implementation-for-authors">Website Authors</h3>

  ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#290): Add some thoughts here about when and how the API
  should be used, especially with regard to {{unmediated}}.

  <h3 id="implementation-extension">Extension Points</h3>

  As noted in [[#future-work]], there is known interest in extending the API
  defined here to serve use cases beyond those this document addresses. To
  that end, the API is fairly generic, with several explicit extension points.

  <div class="example">
    If we wished to add a new credential type, how would we spell it out?

    <ol>
      <li>
        Define a new <code>ExampleCredential</code> that inherits from
        {{Credential}}, and define the value of its {{[[type]]}} slot:

        <pre>
          interface ExampleCredential : Credential {
            // Definition goes here.
          };

          ...

          All `ExampleCredential` objects have their <a idl>[[type]]</a> slot's
          value set to the string "example".
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Define the options that the new credential type requires, and add them
        to the {{CredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary with a property name that
        matches the {{[[type]]}} slot's value.

        <pre>
          dictionary ExampleCredentialRequestOptions {
            // Definition goes here.
          };

          partial dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
            ExampleCredentialRequestOptions? example;
          };
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add <code>ExampleCredential</code> to the switch in step 8 of
        [[#request-credential]], and define the request behavior necessary to
        grab and return the new type.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add <code>ExampleCredential</code> to the switch in step 6 of
        [[#store-credential]], and define the persistance behavior necessary to
        store the new type.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  You might also need new primitives. For instance, you might want to return
  many {{Credential}} objects rather than just one. That might be accomplished
  in a generic fashion by adding a <code>getAll()</code> method to
  {{CredentialsContainer}}, and defining a <code>CredentialSet</code> object that
  contained a <code>sequence&lt;Credential&gt;</code>, and could be easily
  extended to meet some use case.

  For any such extension, we recommend getting in touch with
  <a href="mailto:public-webappsec@w3.org">public-webappsec@</a> for
  consultation and review.

  <h3 id="implementation-browser-extensions">Browser Extensions</h3>

  Ideally, user agents that implement an extension system of some sort will
  allow third-parties to hook into these API endpoints in order to improve
  the behavior of third party credential management software in the same way
  that user agents can improve their own via this imperative approach.

  This could range from a complex new API that the user agent mediates, or
  simply by allowing extensions to overwrite the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}
  and {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} endpoints for their own purposes.

  <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The API defined here does the bare minimum to expose user agent's credential
  managers to the web, and allows the web to help those credential managers
  understand when <a>federated identity providers</a> are in use. The next
  logical step will be along the lines sketched in documents like [[WEB-LOGIN]]
  (and, to some extent, Mozilla's BrowserID [[BROWSERID]]).

  The user agent is in the unique position of being able to effectively mediate
  the relationship between users, identity providers, and websites. If the user
  agent can remove some of the risk and confusion associated with the typical
  authentication flows, users will be in a significantly better position than
  today.

  A natural way to expose this information might be to extend the
  {{FederatedCredential}} interface with properties like authentication tokens,
  and possibly to add some form of manifest format with properties that declare
  the authentication type which the provider supports.

  The API described here is designed to be extensible enough to support use
  cases that require user interaction, perhaps with websites other than the one
  which requested credentials. We hope that the Promise-based system we've
  settled on is extensible enough to support these kinds of asynchronous flows
  which could require some level of interaction between multiple browsing
  contexts (e.g. mediated activity on <code>idp.com</code> might resolve a
  Promise handed back to <code>rp.com</code>) in the future without redesigning
  the API from the ground up.

  Baby steps.

  <div class="note">
    Groups like the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments IG</a>
    and the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials CG</a>
    have expressed interest in extending the API defined in this document in
    order to address use cases beyond those outlined in [[#use-cases]]. They've
    documented these use cases in detail in
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use Cases 1.0</a>
    and
    <a href="http://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/">Credentials CG Use Cases</a>,
    and anticipate extending the API in a separate document to solve a different
    set of problems than WebAppSec is currently chartered to deal with.
